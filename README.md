## Hiya!ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my (seemingly) empty GitHub profile! It's all top-secret personal projects that the world will never see!

- I'm a software engineering student at the University of Oslo and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. 
- I also work part time in IT for a large tech consulting firm. If the world had enough time I'd totally sit down and automate half my job ðŸ˜Ž
- My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨, rocketsðŸš€ and music!ðŸŽµ And, for *natural* (heh) reasons, the physics related to those!
  - I'd love to learn signal processing to program (small) DAWs or VST instruments like synthesizers, etc, if I ever get enough time ðŸ˜Œ
  - I'm also looking forward to working with databases and such later in my degre- I hope it'll give me some opportunitites to work with Earth observation using satelite data for assignments or other uni-related stuff.

### Automation
- [x] Play around with requests in Python using the [Space Traders API](https://spacetraders.io/)

- [x] Python + AHK macro that scrapes selected websites for vocabulary words and makes flashcards in Anki (ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§

- [x] ~~The first major goal is to automate generation of Azure/AD Auth tokens and temporary passwords for setting up new enterprise machines.~~ We did it boys. Friendship ended with AHK, new best friend is SeleniumðŸ˜Ž

### Work stuff
Also been tampering with automation and macro programming for work, with the end goal of automating all those tiresome mouse clicks!

- [ ] Currently trying to figure out how to use Power Automate to automatically read a shared O365 mailbox, uploading replies to a Sharepoint site and then replying to emails that are handled. <br> Also considering just figuring out how to make an SSO-compatible script to do the same without going through all the weird Microsoft stuff. 

### Web stuff
Learning a slice of web development now. 
- [x] Currently creating a custom start page, currently rendered using plain markup and a miniscule amount of JS.
- [ ] It needs to get prettier. I think I'll look into Electron or Flutter maybe.
