## Hiya!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my (currently) somewhat empty GitHub profile! I'm a software engineering student at the University of Oslo and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨, rocketsðŸš€ and music!ðŸŽµ And, for *natural* (heh) reasons, the physics related to those!

## ðŸ“šCurrent projects
Recently been playing HTTPs and requests using Python! 

Just finished a Python AHK macro that scrapes websites makes vocabulary flashcards in Japanese for me (ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§

Also been tampering with automation and macro programming for work, with the end goal of automating all those tiresome mouse clicks!

[x] ~~The first major goal is to automate generation of Azure/AD Auth tokens and temporary passwords for setting up new enterprise machines.~~
We did it boys. Friendship ended with AHK, new best friend is SeleniumðŸ˜Ž

Then I'll see if I can automate device assignment and stock locations.

If that goes well, I'll poke arond and try automating the imaging and setup process.

Learning a slice of web development now. Currently creating a custom start page, currently rendered using plain markup and a miniscule amount of JS.
Update! It now runs on more Javascript and is locally hosted! Next step Electron maybe?
