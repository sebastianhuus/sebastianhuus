### Hiya!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my (currently) very empty GitHub profile! I'm a soon-to-be computer science student starting this autumn and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨ and rockets!ðŸš€ And of course the physics related to those!
