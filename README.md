Welcome to my (currently) somewhat empty GitHub profile! I'm a software engineering student at the University of Oslo and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨, rocketsðŸš€ and music!ðŸŽµ And, for *natural* (heh) reasons, the physics related to those!

## ðŸ“šCurrent projects

### Automation
- [x] Play around with requests in Python using the [Space Traders API](https://spacetraders.io/)

- [x] Python + AHK macro that scrapes websites for vocabulary words and makes flashcards in Anki (ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§

- [x] ~~The first major goal is to automate generation of Azure/AD Auth tokens and temporary passwords for setting up new enterprise machines.~~ We did it boys. Friendship ended with AHK, new best friend is SeleniumðŸ˜Ž

Also been tampering with automation and macro programming for work, with the end goal of automating all those tiresome mouse clicks!

- [ ] Currently trying to figure out how to use Power Automate to automatically scan a shared O365 mailbox, uploading replies to a Sharepoint site and then replying to emails that are handled.

### Web stuff
Learning a slice of web development now. Currently creating a custom start page, currently rendered using plain markup and a miniscule amount of JS.

Update! It now runs on more Javascript and is locally hosted! Next step is Electron maybe?
