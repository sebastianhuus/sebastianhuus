## Hiya!ðŸ‘‹

**About me**

<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats-chi-navy-90.vercel.app/api?username=sebastianhuus&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=jolly&hide_title=true"/>

- Taking a bachelor's degree in *programming and system architecture* at the University of Oslo.
- Working in local tech support at Accenture, mostly managing my team and making sure stuff works.

I don't do much programming at my job but it is cool to work with big-name tools such as Azure, Windows servers and ServiceNOW. 

I'm interested in space, rockets and music. I hope I'll get time to work on hobby projects in these fields.

**Future plans**
- Plan to major in astrophysics or space systems after my bachelor's degree.
- Want to learn signal processing to make a DAW and VST instruments, like synthesizers or maybe modelling real instruments - like [SWAM](https://audiomodeling.com/swam-engine)'s stuff.
- Also want to learn how to work with satellite data and Earth observation (hence the plan to major in something space-related)
