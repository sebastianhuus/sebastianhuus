### Hiya!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my (currently) very empty GitHub profile! I'm a software engineering student at the University of Oslo and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨, rocketsðŸš€ and music!ðŸŽµ And of course the physics related to those!

Recently been playing HTTPs and requests using Python! 

Also been tampering with automation and macro programming with AutoHotKey and Python, with the end goal of automating ALL the button clicks at work!
