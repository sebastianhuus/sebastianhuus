### Hiya!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my (currently) very empty GitHub profile! I'm a soon-to-be computer science student starting this autumn and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨, rocketsðŸš€ and music!ðŸŽµ And of course the physics related to those!

Currently trying to learn Javascript through Electron. Been fun so far!

And now I've moved on to HTTP and requests using Python! Woo!
