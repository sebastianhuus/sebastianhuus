## Hiya!ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my (seemingly) empty GitHub profile! It's all top-secret personal projects that the world will never see!

- I'm a software engineering student at the University of Oslo and I'm super excited to learn about pretty much all there is about *everything*. 
- I also work part time in IT for a large tech consulting firm. If the world had enough time I'd totally sit down and automate half my job ðŸ˜Ž
- My main interests are âœ¨*space*âœ¨, rocketsðŸš€ and music!ðŸŽµ And, for *natural* (heh) reasons, the physics related to those!
  - I'd love to learn signal processing to program (small) DAWs or VST instruments like synthesizers, etc, if I ever get enough time ðŸ˜Œ
  - I'm also looking forward to working with databases and such later in my degre- I hope it'll give me some opportunitites to work with Earth observation using satelite data for assignments or other uni-related stuff.

I'd have some words about my current projects here, but the previous text here got outdated :p
